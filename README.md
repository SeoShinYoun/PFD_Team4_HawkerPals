# PFD_Team4_HawkerPals
Android-based application using Kotlin which aims to create a B2B marketplace for hawker stall owners to sell their soon-to-be expired raw ingredients to other hawker stall owners that are running low on raw ingredients due to their popularity.

Context:
With raw ingredients experiencing a surge in price fuelled by global supply chain disruption and international conflicts, over 500+ F&B outlets in Singapore have closed their business since the pandemic given that raw ingredients already represent 60% of total cost to a typical hawker stall. Hence, the application aims to increase the sustainability of hawker businesses around Singapore by decreasing their reliance on B2C sales by diversifying to B2B sales instead. 

Benefits to new hawker startups and relatively-less popular hawker stalls:
1) Minimize food wastage
2) Increase sustainability of business by increasing cost-savings

Benefits to popular hawker stalls:
1) Increase profitability of business by meeting high demand
2) Decrease cost of purchase for raw ingredients
